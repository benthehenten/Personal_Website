<a href = "http://whotweeted.it"><i>Who Tweeted It</i></a> is a game I made with <a href="http://danrs.ch">Dan Schlosser</a> and <a href="http://evantarrh.com">Evan Tarrh</a> at Columbia's devfest hackathon in February, 2014. We used the Twitter Api to get tweets from popular celebrities and make a simple quiz game. We used a python/flask backend and foundation in the front to make it look nice. We won a prize from Google at the hackathon, but the real reward was having over 16,000 page views in the first 2 weeks after launch across 44 states, and 39 countries--all from us posting about it on facebook and twitter.
