<a href = "http://whotweeted.it"><i>Who Tweeted It</i></a> is a game I made with <a href="http://danrs.ch">Dan Schlosser</a> and <a href="http://evantarrh.com">Evan Tarrh</a> at Columbia's devfest hackathon in February, 2014. We used the Twitter API to get tweets from popular celebrities and make a simple quiz game. It's built on a python/flask backend with foundation in front to make it look nice. We won a prize from Google at the hackathon, but the real reward was having over 16,000 page views in the first 2 weeks! We had visitors from 44 different states and 39 countries.

 This is my personal website that I built in March, 2014. Its (limited) backend is based on python and flask, while in front it's standard html/css/js. For now, the only page other than the spalsh screen is this projects page; however, I will soon integrate a blog and other content. I found this project to be a great learning experience as it was the first website I built entirely from scratch. 


 FB Photo Share was a project I worked on in May-June 2014 that aimed to allow the easy sharing of Facebook photos outside of Facebook's ecosystem. I noticted that my mom would often tell my grandmother to join facebook to see nice pictures of her grandkids, but she had no interest in using a new and comlicated technology. Instead, with FBPhotoshare, my mom could log in with Facebook, choose photos of herself and her friends, and create an album that is viewable by anyone with the unique URL. I built FBPhotoshare using AngularJS (an unpleasant technology that I hope to never use again), mongodb, flask, and python. Unfortunatley, Facebook will soon be deprecating the API routes that made FBPhotoshare possible, so I discontinued development while the site was in beta.


Neurotome is a project that I worked on in my (summer,2014) internship at the NIH.  which is a crowdsourcing platform for the analysis of electron-microscopy images of the brain.
