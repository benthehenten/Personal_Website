<a href = "http://whotweeted.it"><i>Who Tweeted It</i></a> is a game I made with <a href="http://danrs.ch">Dan Schlosser</a> and <a href="http://evantarrh.com">Evan Tarrh</a> at Columbia's devfest hackathon in February, 2014. We used the Twitter API to get tweets from popular celebrities and make a simple quiz game. It's built on a python/flask backend with foundation in front to make it look nice. We won a prize from Google at the hackathon, but the real reward was having over 16,000 page views in the first 2 weeks! We had visitors from 44 different states and 39 countries.

 This is my personal website that I built in March, 2014. Its (limited) backend is based on python and flask, while in front it's standard html/css/js. For now, the only page other than the spalsh screen is this projects page; however, I will soon integrate a blog and other content. I found this project to be a great learning experience as it was the first website I built entirely from scratch. 


 FB Photo Share was a project I worked on in May-June 2014 that aimed to allow the easy sharing of Facebook photos outside of Facebook's ecosystem. A user could log in with Facebook, choose pictures of them and their friends, and publish an album sharable with its unique URL.  I built FBPhotoshare using AngularJS, mongodb, flask, and python. Unfortunatley, Facebook will soon be deprecating the API routes that made FBPhotoshare possible, so I discontinued development while the site was in beta.


Neurotome is a project that I worked on in my summer, 2014 internship at the NIH.  Neurotome is a crowdsourcing platform for the analysis of electron-microscopy images of the brain. By playing a drawing game, users provide training data for a neural network which will one day be able to generate a neruon-scale map of the 100B+ neurons in the brain. I have continued working with the NIH team on this project and we hope to launch publicly in a few months.
